      <p style="text-align:center;">So Mr.O Lantern had a harsh life, he was born an orphan, no parents, no one to care about him... alright let's skip all of the boring stuff of how he grew up and gets his shit straight to the main point of this story. SO O lantern grew up and he was now able to exit the orphanage. But Mr. O was hated among the communities he lived in...he used to live on people's doorsteps begging for money or food. He didn't have a job. On October 31st a day when the moon was full and the night's sky was illuminating with mysterious creatures soaring through it. On this day the demon of the Halloween realm emerged from the ground's soil on someone's front lawn where O Lantern was sitting. The halloween demon heard about the chaos happening in town with this O Lantern guy and was outraged from it. At that moment the demon cursed Mr. O Lantern into a spooky looking pumpkin and was later found by the home owner. Soon the whole country knew about this O Lantern guy and his curse. Later enough, the news spread to the whole world and the pumpkin was then known as the "famous pumpkin of Halloween".</p>
